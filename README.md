# Calculator testing  

We are going to put our testing skills to the test(pun intended) by writing some tests on an existing piece of code.

Within **testing_homework.js**, we have a `calculator` object, along with some starter testing code, so far we have one test already, which tests the `calculator.add()` function, let's finish the rest of the tests!


### Directions
1. Write an it() test for every method within `calculator`
2. If there are any bugs( there are :) ) fix them on the calculator object.
3. Make sure all of your tests that you write are correct.
4. Make all of your tests pass.

**BONUS:**  
Fill out the `calculator.random` function to return a random integer between 1-10(including 10).
Write a test for this to test that it's always returning a number between 1-10.
